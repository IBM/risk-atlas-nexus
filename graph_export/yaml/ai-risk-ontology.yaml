  name: 'AILuminate: Introducing v1.0 of the AI Risk and Reliability Benchmark from
    MLCommons'
  description: The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an
    urgent need for standard safety-evaluation  frameworks. This paper introduces
    AILuminate v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for  assessing
    AI-product risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that
    included participants  from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's
    resistance to prompts designed to elicit dangerous,  illegal, or undesirable behavior
    in 12 hazard categories, including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related  crimes,
    child sexual exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual
    property, privacy,  defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election,
    financial, health, legal). Our method  incorporates a complete assessment standard,
    extensive prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework,  a grading and reporting
    system, and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term
    support  and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable
    five-tier grading scale (Poor to Excellent)  and incorporates an innovative entropy-based
    system-response evaluation. In addition to unveiling the benchmark,  this report
    also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally,
    including  evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions.
    This work represents a crucial step toward  establishing global standards for
    AI risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued  development
    in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of
    additional languages,  and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable
    insights for model developers, system integrators,  and policymakers working to
    promote safer AI deployment.

  name: 'The AI Risk Repository: A Comprehensive Meta-Review, Database, and Taxonomy
    of Risks From Artificial Intelligence'
  description: 'The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable
    concern to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However,
    a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively
    discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating
    an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises
    a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered
    based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated
    via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic
    review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed
    by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit
    framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each
    risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional,
    Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level
    Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination
    & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &
    misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and
    (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into
    23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt
    to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly
    accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates
    a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining,
    auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.'

    policies from the European Union, United States, and China and 16 company policies
    worldwide, making a significant step towards establishing a unified language for
    generative AI safety evaluation. We identify 314 unique risk categories, organized
    into a four-tiered taxonomy. At the highest level, this taxonomy encompasses System
    & Operational Risks, Content Safety Risks, Societal Risks, and Legal & Rights
    Risks. The taxonomy establishes connections between various descriptions and approaches
    to risk, highlighting the overlaps and discrepancies between public and private
    sector conceptions of risk. By providing this unified framework, we aim to advance
    AI safety through information sharing across sectors and the promotion of best
    practices in risk mitigation for generative AI models and systems.

  description: To assess the transparency of the foundation model ecosystem and help
    improve transparency over time, we introduce the Foundation Model Transparency
    Index. The Foundation Model Transparency Index specifies 100 fine-grained indicators
    that comprehensively codify transparency for foundation models, spanning the upstream
    resources used to build a foundation model (e.g data, labor, compute), details
    about the model itself (e.g. size, capabilities, risks), and the downstream use
    (e.g. distribution channels, usage policies, affected geographies). We score 10
    major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google, Meta) against the 100
    indicators to assess their transparency. To facilitate and standardize assessment,
    we score developers in relation to their practices for their flagship foundation
    model (e.g. GPT-4 for OpenAI, PaLM 2 for Google, Llama 2 for Meta).

  name: 'OpenWebMath: An Open Dataset of High-Quality Mathematical Web Text'
  description: There is growing evidence that pretraining on high quality, carefully
    thought-out tokens such as code or mathematics plays an important role in improving
    the reasoning abilities of large language models. For example, Minerva, a PaLM
    model finetuned on billions of tokens of mathematical documents from arXiv and
    the web, reported dramatically improved performance on problems that require quantitative
    reasoning. However, because all known open source web datasets employ preprocessing
    that does not faithfully preserve mathematical notation, the benefits of large
    scale training on quantitive web documents are unavailable to the research community.
    We introduce OpenWebMath, an open dataset inspired by these works containing 14.7B
    tokens of mathematical webpages from Common Crawl. We describe in detail our method
    for extracting text and LaTeX content and removing boilerplate from HTML documents,
    as well as our methods for quality filtering and deduplication. Additionally,
    we run small-scale experiments by training 1.4B parameter language models on OpenWebMath,
    showing that models trained on 14.7B tokens of our dataset surpass the performance
    of models trained on over 20x the amount of general language data. We hope that
    our dataset, openly released on the Hugging Face Hub, will help spur advances
    in the reasoning abilities of large language models.

  description: We introduce the Granite Guardian models, a suite of safeguards designed

    use in combination with any large language model (LLM). These models offer comprehensive
    coverage across multiple risk dimensions, including social bias, profanity, violence,
    sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and hallucination-related risks
    such as context relevance, groundedness, and answer relevance for retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG). Trained on a unique dataset combining human annotations from
    diverse sources and synthetic data, Granite Guardian models address risks typically
    overlooked by traditional risk detection models, such as jailbreaks and RAG-specific
    issues. With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related
    benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive
    model available in the space. Released as open-source, Granite Guardian aims to
    promote responsible AI development across the community.

    (sometimes referred to as tools, skills or plugins by different vendors) to undertake
    actions in response to a prompt. The decision over which extension to invoke may

    or LLM output. Agent-based systems will typically make repeated calls to an LLM
    using output from previous invocations to ground and direct subsequent invocations.
    Excessive Agency is the vulnerability that enables damaging actions to be performed

    vulnerability in order to succeed. Unbounded Consumption occurs when a Large Language
