# risk-atlas-nexus
Risk Atlas Nexus aims to provide tooling to help bring together disparate resources related to governance of foundation models. We aim to support a community driven approach to curating and cataloguing resources such as datasets, benchmarks and mitigations.  Our goal is to turn abstract risk definitions into actionable workflows that streamline AI governance processes. By connecting fragmented resources, Risk Atlas Nexus seeks to fill a critical gap in AI governance, enabling stakeholders to build more robust, transparent, and accountable systems.
