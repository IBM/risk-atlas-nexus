# Mappings

- Mappings should be stored in .tsv files this folder.
- The mappings are lifted from the the tsv files to the yaml format and stored in the yaml data mappings folder, with the help of a script in the makefile.


**Disclaimer**: some of the mappings in this folder have been generated or refined with the help of LLM : "ibm/granite-20b-code-instruct"
